[00:02.81] Greetings loved ones
[00:05.05] Let's take a journey
[00:15.05] 
[00:07.78] I know a place
[00:10.73] Where the grass is really greener
[00:14.76] Warm, wet, and wild
[00:18.65] There must be somethin' in the water
[00:22.99] Sippin' gin and juice
[00:26.32] Layin' underneath the palm trees (undone)
[00:30.46] The boys break their necks
[00:34.07] Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)
[00:55.57] 
[00:39.06] You could travel the world
[00:42.16] But nothing comes close to the golden coast
[00:46.60] Once you party with us
[00:49.67] You'll be fallin' in love
[00:51.53] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:01.53] 
[00:53.90] California girls, we're unforgettable
[00:57.67] Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
[01:01.05] Sun-kissed skin, so hot
[01:03.32] We'll melt your popsicle
[01:05.40] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:08.65] California girls, we're undeniable
[01:12.92] Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
[01:16.77] West Coast represent
[01:18.61] Now put your hands up
[01:20.87] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:35.87] 
[01:24.48] Sex (sex) on the beach
[01:27.49] We don't mind sand in our stilettos
[01:31.77] We freak in my Jeep
[01:34.90] Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh
[01:53.40] 
[01:39.93] You could travel the world (you could travel the world)
[01:43.01] But nothing comes close to the golden coast
